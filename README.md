# WhisperX Worker for RunPod

A serverless worker that provides high-quality speech transcription with timestamp alignment and speaker diarization using WhisperX on the RunPod platform.

## Features

- Automatic speech transcription with WhisperX
- Automatic language detection
- Word-level timestamp alignment
- Speaker diarization (optional)
- Highly parallelized batch processing
- Voice activity detection with configurable parameters
- RunPod serverless compatibility

## Usage Examples

### Basic Transcription

```json
{
  "input": {
    "audio_file": "https://example.com/audio/sample.mp3"
  }
}
```

### Transcription with Language Detection and Alignment

```json
{
  "input": {

      },
      {
        "name": "Speaker2",
        "url": "https://example.com/speaker2.wav"
      },
      {
        "name": "Speaker3",
        "url": "https://example.com/speaker3.wav"
      }
      ...
    ]
  }
}
## Output Format

The service returns a JSON object structured as follows:

    }
  ],
  "detected_language": "en",
  "language_probability": 0.997,
  "speakers": {

    "SPEAKER_02": {"name": "Speaker 2", "time": 2.5}
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- **GPU Memory**: Adjust `batch_size` based on available GPU memory for optimal performance
- **Processing Time**: Enabling diarization and alignment will increase processing time
- **File Size**: Large audio files may require more processing time and resources
- **Language Detection**: For shorter audio clips, language detection may be less accurate

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Model was trained with pyannote.audio 0.0.1, yours is X.X.X"**
   - This is a warning only and shouldn't affect functionality in most cases
   - If issues persist, consider downgrading pyannote.audio

2. **Diarization failures**
   - Ensure you're providing a valid HuggingFace access token
   - Try specifying reasonable min/max speaker values
